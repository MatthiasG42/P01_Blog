Udacity Web Front End - Project 01 Blog

This is the first project for the Udacity Front End Web Developer program.
The blog of Beijing is written out, the one of New York has filler text. Shanghai is an empty link.
Also the links in the footer copyright, agb and contact are empty, everything else has content.

Thanks!
Matthias
